# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is about a television show on the Cartoon Network called, "We Bare Bears".

barebears.html - Is the homepage. It includes 4 hyperlinks to other pages. (grizz.html, panda.html, icebear.html & thecreator.html)

It includes an unordered list, a table and an image.

I have incorporated bootstrap 4 onto the page and have made use of the 'alert' component to organise the hyperlinks. I have also made use of bootstrap columns, as soon at the top of the page.
